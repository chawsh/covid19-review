Infection also induces other immune responses.
The development of memory B cells and memory T cells has also been assessed in several studies.
Dan et al. (2021) showed that SARS-CoV-2 S-specific memory B cell levels rose steadily over the first 120 days following symptom onset [@doi:10.1126/science.abf4063].
Receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific memory B cells had been detected in COVID-19 patients 90 days post-symptom onset in previous studies [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.11.029; @pmid:33443036], and this study confirms these finding and shows that levels of these cells increased over the 4-5 months post-symptom onset [@doi:10.1126/science.abf4063].
Gaebler et al. have shown that memory B cells specific to the RBD remain unaltered and exhibit clonal turnover and antibody sequence evolution 6 months post infection, indicative of prolonged germinal cell reactions [@doi:10.1038/s41586-021-03207-w].
The same study showed that antibodies expressed by these memory B cells have resistance to RBD mutations, greater somatic hypermutations, and increased potency, which the authors suggest might be evidence of continued evolution of humoral immunity [@doi:10.1038/s41586-021-03207-w].
Indeed, Wheatley et al. showed that S-specific IgG^+^ memory B cells consistently increase over time and by 4 months comprise approximately 0.8% of all IgG^+^ memory B cells, which may indicate cellular immune memory to even mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection [@doi:10.1038/s41467-021-21444-5].
Dan et al. (2021) showed that N-specific memory B cells steadily increased up to 4-5 months post-symptom onset [@doi:10.1126/science.abf4063].
SARS-CoV-2 memory CD8^+^ T cells were also detected in 70% of 169 COVID-19 patients after 1 month [@doi:10.1126/science.abf4063], which is consistent with previous research [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.05.015].
These approaches all evaluated indicators that can be used to gain insight into prior infection.
